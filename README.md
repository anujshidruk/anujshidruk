👋 Hi, I'm Anuj Shidruk Programmer by skill, creator by heart 💡👨‍💻

🚀 Currently building personal projects and advancing my skills in Python.

💡 Passionate about learning and actively listening to those who guide me — especially people who have real experience in this field in recent years.

📖 Everything I’m learning is possible because of the guidance and help of someone who has already walked this path. 🙏 I don’t personally know them, but their work and knowledge have made a big impact on me. A special thank you to to that person, your influence truly matters.
